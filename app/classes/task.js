   * This constructor is intended to be used when loading an object from firebase but it can be used for when a user creates a new object as well.
   * @param {String} name Name of the task
   * @param {int} deadline When the task is due. Maybe use Date.now()? Date.now() returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC.
   * @param {int} points How many points is the task worth
   * @param {int} repeat How often should the task repeat? We could use milliseconds since Date.now() uses milliseconds. If it does not repeat, you could pass in null.
   * @param {int} startDate when the task was made
   * @param {String} description A brief description of the task
   * @param {String} householdID The id of the household this task belongs to
   * @param {String} completed Null if task is incomplete. personID of person who completed the task if the task is complete
   * @param {String} inProgress Null if task is not in progress. personID of person who completed the task if the task is in progress
   * @param {String} assigned Who was assigned the task
   * @param {String} taskID the id of the task
